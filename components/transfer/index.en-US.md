## Warning

According the standard of Vue, the key should always be supplied directly to the elements in the array. In Transfer, the keys should be set on the elements included in `dataSource` array. By default, `key` property is used as an unique identifier.

If there's no `key` in your data, you should use `rowKey` to specify the key that will be used for uniquely identify each element.

```jsx
// eg. your primary key is `uid`
return <Transfer :rowKey="record => record.uid" />;
```
